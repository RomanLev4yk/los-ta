Example: duration = 1, amount = 9900, currency = EUR, persons = 1|2|3, extra_person_price is 2000 means that the nightly rate is 99.00 EUR for 1 person.
For two persons the price is 99.00 + 20.00 = 119.00 EUR. For three persons the price is 119.00 + 20.00 = 139.00 EUR

Example: duration = 1, amount = 9900, currency = EUR, persons = 2|3|4|5|6, extra_person_price is 2000 means that the nightly rate is 99.00 EUR for 2 persons.
For two persons the price is 99.00. For three persons the price is 99.00 + 20.00 = 119.00 EUR. For four persons the price is 119.00 + 20.00 = 139.00 EUR
